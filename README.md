## SSPE Archive

This is my archive for the recently discontinued SSPE Shader for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

You can find the original dropbox folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/djic3ceo7ea7rtq/AACshpLoPxVHbG4ODU2gY9lma?dl=0).

You can also find a snapshot of RyFol's site [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20180204120128/https://ryfol.weebly.com/). In the future i will try to recreate this in this repo.

------

In each folder you will find a `.mcpack` file and a `.zip` file. I will try and add changelogs in each folder in the future.
